# Arduino @ Google Summer of Code

Arduino was a mentoring organization for GSoC 2020. This repository stores the relevant information.

> ⚠️ Arduino is not applying for GSoC 2021, but any contribution to our open source projects is very welcome!

[Arduino](https://arduino.cc) is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - tens of millions of students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is an annual global program for university students focused on open-source software and sponsored by Google. For general information about the program, including this year's application timeline and key phases involved, please see the [GSoC website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/).

## Why should I work with Arduino?

Arduino is fully committed to creating open-source hardware and software. The Arduino community is one of the largest tech communities in the world, and our collaborative efforts have a big impact on democratizing electronics. Working with us is a great opportunity to work on code that is used daily by millions of people. The quality of the Arduino hardware, as well as the Arduino software and libraries, is what glued this community: will you work with us to improve all this?

## How can I apply?

* Read [the application guide](how-to-apply.md) and the [ideas list](ideas.md).
* Open an issue in this [issue tracker](https://github.com/arduino/summer-of-code/issues) (only **one issue per student**): you can use it to ask questions and communicate with us.

The issue tracker of this repository is the preferred way to communicate with us. Should you have private inquiries, send an e-mail to [summer-of-code@arduino.cc](mailto:summer-of-code@arduino.cc).
