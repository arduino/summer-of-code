# GSoC @ Arduino: Ideas List

## Write examples for official libraries

[Libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/libraries) are a fundamental component of Arduino. They allow users to enrich their applications with advanced functionality or to support shields, sensors, actuators connected to their Arduino board.
We now have more than 70 [official libraries](https://github.com/arduino-libraries), in addition to 2,400+ contributed libraries.
Many of those official libraries need more examples in order to help users understand how they can be used. Examples are located in the same repository as the library itself.

* *Languages:* C++
* *Difficulty:* Easy/Medium (according to the libraries complexity)
* *Note:* your application should contain a list of libraries which need examples and which you would like to work on.

## Write MicroPython examples and tools for Portenta

The new [Portenta](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/hardware/product/portenta-h7) board supports [MicroPython](https://micropython.org) in addition to Arduino code. This combination opens up many new opportunities. This task is about writing examples about using MicroPython on a Portenta board.

* *Languages:* Python, C++
* *Difficulty:* Medium/Advanced
* *Note:* accepted students will be sent a free Portenta board (The Portenta boards will be ready for shipment approximately at the end of March 2020).

## Write JerryScript (JavaScript) examples and tools for Portenta

The new [Portenta](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/hardware/product/portenta-h7) board supports [JerryScript](https://jerryscript.net) in addition to Arduino code. This combination opens up many new opportunities. This task is about writing examples about using MicroPython on a Portenta board.

* *Languages:* JavaScript, C++
* *Difficulty:* Medium/Advanced
* *Note:* accepted students will be sent a free Portenta board.

## Add network discovery support to arduino-cli

[arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) is a command line tool for programming Arduino boards. This task is about implementing a functionality for discovering boards over network in addition to USB.
See more details in https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/issues/344

* *Languages:* Go
* *Difficulty:* Advanced
